/** This is very simple class, more to describe than to do.
 * This class converts given style according to global Nootka settings.
 * It gives possibility to have name style always matched with user preferences
 * even if exam file was generated with other styles.
 * In fact, there are three possible name styles:
 * - solfege Do Re ...
 * - letter with sign C# Db
 * - letter full name Cis Des
 * All that e_italiano_Si or e_english_Bb depends on:
 * Tnote::EnameStyle NsolfegeStyle
 * bool seventhIs_B
 * declared in Tglobals.
 * get(Tnote::EnameStyle style) static method returns proper style.
