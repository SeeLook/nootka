Install instructions for Tartini (version 1.1)

To compile Tartini 1.1 from the source:

Step 1.
Make sure the following libraries are installed on your system
- Qt 4.x
- fftw3   (configured with the --enable-float option)
- Qwt 5.x
(these can be downloaded from http://www.tartini.net)


Step 2.
Edit pitch.pro and put the correct library and include paths for your setup.


Step 3.
At the command prompt (from in the directory) type:
qmake pitch.pro       - This will generate a Makefile
make                  - This will compile the executable called tartini.

Note: To compile on Windows you need to use MinGW (www.mingw.org),
since Qt4 is not supported for Visual Studio under the GPL edition.

Note: qmake comes as part of the Qt4 package
