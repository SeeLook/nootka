Plan for the Nootka One

ISSUES
- try to close out stream for pulse - it sucks or get rid of pulse
- charts hang with updating (probably related to re-sizing, scaling)
- stop guitar work when it is invisible
- chunkPitch is emitted too often - it could be adjusted to eye possibility
- add string numbers to generated pixmap and do string number in text color
- note name on a score still is there but seldom

Russian tr
- no abbreviations in tab "names" (settings) and tab accidentals (Level Creator) just line breaks (\n)
			
TODOES
- setAmbitus in TnoteName seems to has no use
- stop audio-in test when audio settings tab is switched off
- check 'tune' of non guitar - does it correspond with instrument/clef scale and levels works proper
- left-handed guitar correction anim to guitar (morphing) has wrong line points
- try to remove re-sizing a status label in exams/exercises
- name label shows not centered texts in exams
- update screen-shoot image in exam help
- force 'Plasique' style under MacOs or find a way on buttons
- !!!check does 'string order' work for Tfingerboard!!!
- sniffer has setAmbitus to guitar scale range - fix it!!!
- make order with Qt::WA_TransparentForMouseEvents in canvas
- remove unused classes: widgets/animations
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos



TO CONSIDERATION
  - add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)




TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required   
    
================================================================================================================
Somewhere in time
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- add option of playing sound during capture
- convert pointers requiring to be 0 to QPointer type
- better and equal algorithm of questioning
- add setFlag(ItemHasNoContents) to QGraphicsItem sub-classes don't has a paint() - used as containers only
- convert level file to text format (for sure) and exam file as well (consider)
