Plan for the Nootka One

urgent:
- clef menu doesn't disappear after mouse leave under win
- clef menu position is wrong in some Qt styles
- add link to wiki about octaves on octave buttons


- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- splash screen
- add notifications
- finish exam tip

- positions and look of frets numbers and key names in charts
- add string numbers to pixmap


TGLOBALS & TTUNE
    - let setTune has reference Ttune& as parameter



SETTINGS DIALOG
	
	- avoid a size biger than screen resolution

      

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- check is possible to given exam file
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
