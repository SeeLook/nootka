Plan for the Nootka One


ISSUES
- exercises
		
- sometimes exam doesn't ask mistaken questions again
- levels are unsaved after loading
- tip position over guitar when no guitar
- note pixmap doesn't displays lower staff when note is on upper (however it makes sense)

			
TODOES
- update screen-shoot image in exam help
- force 'Plasique' style under MacOs or find a way on buttons
- selecting clef for non guitar in wizard
- force a maximum score width especially for 4:3 ratios
- audio-in settings TODO 
- !!!check does 'string order' work for Tfingerboard!!!
- new exam and level version is necessary, 
		add version recognition to avoid old releases opening newest versions
- sniffer has setAmbitus to guitar scale range - fix it!!!
- remove unused classes: widgets/animations
- in level creator disable 'show string number' when guitar is unavailable 
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos

- finish exam tip and saving it (image) to file

- make order with jack (thread-ise input, format conversion)


TO CONSIDERATION
  . missing correcting of wrong/unclear pitch
  - show note name during correction
  - add repeat answer to exercises
  - add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)
  - add string numbers to generated pixmap

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required   
    
================================================================================================================
Somewhere in time
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
