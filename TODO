Plan for the Nootka One

To Luster
		'wrong intonation' or 'unclear' or out of tune'

- levels are unsaved after loading
- new exam and level version is necessary, 
		add version recognition to avoid old releases opening newest versions
- sniffer has setAmbitus to guitar scale range - fix it!!!
- under windows guitar head glyph doesn't appear in guitar settings.
- level validation: when q: score & a: score or Q: name A: name and no different accidentals - switch solfege/letters
- consider to remove accidental symbol from NoteName question - pressed accid button should be sufficient.
- consider to have octave buttons in one row when there is enough space and in two rows when not only
- set better position of answer/repeat tip
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos
- There are similar position calculations in Tcanvas - make methods for them
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- finish exam tip
- managing level and exam files and their paths
- practicing MODE

- add sound during wizard and About dialog

- add string numbers to pixmap
- make order with jack (thread-ise input, format conversion)

TGLOBALS & TTUNE
    - let setTune has reference Ttune& as parameter



SETTINGS DIALOG
	- avoid a size biger than screen resolution

      

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- check is possible to given exam file
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
