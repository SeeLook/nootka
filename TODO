Plan for the Nootka One

- changing clef in level range has to invoke need to save
- check storing level path
- consider to remove accidental symbol from NoteName question - pressed accid button should be sufficient.
- set better position of answer/repeat tip
- key signature names could be wider - take space over clef
- level preview has to have got empty table to avoid changing size during filling it
- table of level preview requires some margin/space after grid lines
- try to adjust navList widget width to the widest text in it
- make order with jack (thread-ise input, format convertion)
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos
- check intonation in exams
- There are similar position calculations in Tcanvas - make methods for them
- note name in HTML has two implementations - unify it
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- crossfading of notes during palyback
- finish exam tip
- managing level and exam files and their paths
- practicing MODE

- splash screen
- add sound at start

- add string numbers to pixmap


TGLOBALS & TTUNE
    - let setTune has reference Ttune& as parameter



SETTINGS DIALOG
	- avoid a size biger than screen resolution

      

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- check is possible to given exam file
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
