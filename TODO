    - let setTune has reference Ttune& as parameter



TNOTEVIEW
    - resize string number - it is too big in Windows system

SETTINGS DIALOG
  - disable maximize button on titlebar
	- add "restore defaults" button

      when qusetion is repeated accid buttons are cleaned but "inside" remains checked
