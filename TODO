with wrong note correct key as well
- !!!check does 'string order' work for Tfingerboard!!!
- new exam and level version is necessary, 
		add version recognition to avoid old releases opening newest versions
- sniffer has setAmbitus to guitar scale range - fix it!!!
- in level creator disable 'show string number' when guitar is unavailable 
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- finish exam tip

- add sound during wizard and About dialog

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- check is possible to given exam file
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
