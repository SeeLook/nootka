- improve pitch detection
?? Kodaly names
?? keyboard input for note name widget

- pack sound to ogg, add notifications
- finish exam tip

- positions and look of frets numbers and key names in charts
- add string numbers to pixmap

=====
Mac issues:
- check audioout thread


TGLOBALS & TTUNE
    - let setTune has reference Ttune& as parameter



SETTINGS DIALOG
	- add "restore defaults" button
	- avoid a size biger than screen resolution

TSCOREWIDGETSIMPLE
    - use enableDblAcc in TscoreWidgetSimple to avoid waste hiding or showing dbl accid buttons

      

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- check is possible to given exam file
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required


TNOTEPIXMAP
  - make it resizable - factor doesn't work with clef and accidentals
