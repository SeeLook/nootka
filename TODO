Plan for the Nootka One


ISSUES
		
- sometimes exam doesn't ask mistaken questions again
- tip position over guitar when no guitar
- try to close out stream for pulse - it sucks or get rid of pulse

			
TODOES
- check 'tune' of non guitar - does it correspond with instrument/clef scale and levels works proper
- update screen-shoot image in exam help
- force 'Plasique' style under MacOs or find a way on buttons
- selecting clef for non guitar in wizard
- force a maximum score width especially for 4:3 ratios
- !!!check does 'string order' work for Tfingerboard!!!
- sniffer has setAmbitus to guitar scale range - fix it!!!
- remove unused classes: widgets/animations
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos

- finish exam tip and saving it (image) to file



TO CONSIDERATION
  - show note name during correction
  - add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)
  - add string numbers to generated pixmap

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- enable/disable sniffing during exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required   
    
================================================================================================================
Somewhere in time
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
