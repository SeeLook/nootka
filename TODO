Plan for the Nootka One

ISSUES
- charts hang with updating (probably related to re-sizing, scaling)
- sounds artifacts occurs with PulseAudio (server and ALSA)
- stop guitar work when it is invisible
- chunkPitch is emitted too often - it could be adjusted to eye possibility
- note name on a score still is there but seldom
- correction anim from highlighted string reminds black line
- levels are locked due to instrument type but fret or tune reason is described
- 'instrument' settings tab can be cut off

			
TODOES
- lock 'show string' and 'low pos only' when no answers as guitar and/or sound
- setAmbitus in TnoteName seems to has no use
- stop audio-in test when audio settings tab is switched off
- check 'tune' of non guitar - does it correspond with instrument/clef scale and levels works proper
- left-handed guitar correction anim to guitar (morphing) has wrong line points
- try to remove re-sizing a status label in exams/exercises
- name label shows not centered texts in exams
- use string numbers on pixmap in charts
- force 'Plasique' style under MacOs or find a way on buttons
- !!!check does 'string order' work for Tfingerboard!!!
- sniffer has setAmbitus to guitar scale range - fix it!!!
- make order with Qt::WA_TransparentForMouseEvents in canvas
- remove unused classes: widgets/animations
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos



TO CONSIDERATION
  - add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)




TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required   
    
================================================================================================================
Somewhere in time
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- add option of playing sound during capture
- convert pointers requiring to be 0 to QPointer type
- better and equal algorithm of questioning
- add setFlag(ItemHasNoContents) to QGraphicsItem sub-classes don't has a paint() - used as containers only
- convert level file to text format (for sure) and exam file as well (consider)
