 TexamHelp - universal texts for exam and exercising
 piano staff has problems with correcting answers
 with wrong note correct key as well
			
- clef is locked after exam/exercise
- sometimes exam doesn't ask mistaken questions again
- something wrong with times
- re-sizing cases changing an instrument (do it at start and restore without necessity of re-sizing)
- canvas tips are not scaled!
- !!!check does 'string order' work for Tfingerboard!!!
- fake key name and ? can be too big when key name is short
- levels are unsaved after loading
- new exam and level version is necessary, 
		add version recognition to avoid old releases opening newest versions
- sniffer has setAmbitus to guitar scale range - fix it!!!
- under windows guitar head glyph doesn't appear in guitar settings.
- level validation: when q: score & a: score or Q: name A: name and no different accidentals - switch solfege/letters
- set better position of answer/repeat tip
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- finish exam tip
- managing level and exam files and their paths
- practicing MODE

- add sound during wizard and About dialog

- add string numbers to pixmap
- make order with jack (thread-ise input, format conversion)

TGLOBALS & TTUNE
    - let setTune has reference Ttune& as parameter



SETTINGS DIALOG
	- avoid a size biger than screen resolution

      

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- check is possible to given exam file
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
