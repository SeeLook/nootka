Plan for the Nootka One

			
TODOES
- test pitch detection and its ambitus after setting approved for non guitar
- check 'tune' of non guitar - does it correspond with instrument/clef scale and levels works proper
- test 48000 input dev under windows

- display scordature in analyze window

- try to remove re-sizing a status label in exams/exercises
- piano staff brace height is still random

- make order with Qt::WA_TransparentForMouseEvents in canvas
- remove unused classes: widgets/animations

- add english entries used in desktop file and win installer to *.ts



TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required   
    
================================================================================================================
Somewhere in time
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- improve cooperation a staff with piano staff - merge them somehow
- merge out&in sounds into single call-back method (class)
- add option of playing sound during capture
- add option for configuring fret marks (dots)
- convert pointers requiring to be 0 to QPointer type
- better and equal algorithm of questioning
- add setFlag(ItemHasNoContents) to QGraphicsItem sub-classes don't has a paint() - used as containers only
- convert level file to text format (for sure) and exam file as well (consider)
- preview of questions in Level Creator (list, on the guitar, in the score)
- revert to native style under MacOs when Qt5 
- comparing exams (charts)
- add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)
- make use of QWizard for above

Tnote
			- overload + and - operators to raise/drop a note
			- consider to change TnotesList type to QList<Tnote>
