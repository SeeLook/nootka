Plan for the Nootka One


ISSUES
- left-handed guitar correction anim to guitar (morphing) has wrong line points
- names reminded on a score after close exercise
- try to close out stream for pulse - it sucks or get rid of pulse
- do pixmap of voice/guitar glyph - TpushButtons don't display nootka text properly
- make order with Qt::WA_TransparentForMouseEvents in canvas
- charts hang with updating (probably related to re-sizing, scaling)

			
TODOES
- setAmbitus in TnoteName seems to has no use
- level validation rule: q as fret to a as fret has to have fret range bigger than 5
- check 'tune' of non guitar - does it correspond with instrument/clef scale and levels works proper
- test exams/exercises with hints disabled
- add 'default' as audio device to detect sys-def one during every start
- try to remove re-sizing on status label in exams/exercises
- update screen-shoot image in exam help
- force 'Plasique' style under MacOs or find a way on buttons
- !!!check does 'string order' work for Tfingerboard!!!
- sniffer has setAmbitus to guitar scale range - fix it!!!
- remove unused classes: widgets/animations
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos
- change directions of questions/answers labels in a table in Level Creator



TO CONSIDERATION
  - add sound during wizard and About dialog (???)
  - add string numbers to generated pixmap




TEXAMEXECUTOR
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required   
    
================================================================================================================
Somewhere in time
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- add option of playing sound during capture
- convert pointers requiring to be 0 to QPointer type
- add setFlag(ItemHasNoContents) to QGraphicsItem sub-classes don't has a paint() - used as containers only
- convert level file to text format (for sure) and exam file as well (consider)
