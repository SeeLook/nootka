Plan for the Nootka One

to luster: 
			student's name: - is it correct?
			Show descriptions of the interface's elements. ??? (no ')
			
			ascending - you are thinking too much (just much)
			Uncheck this if you are left-handed<br>and your guitar is strung for left-handed playing (changed string order from EADGBE to EBGDAE)
			- this is a place when tuning and kind of guitar are changed, so could it be just:
			how to make it a bit shorter:
			   guitar strung for right-handed players
			Uncheck this if you are left-handed<br>and your guitar is strung for left-handed playing (changed string order)
			
			Nootka will tell you about what you've been thinking for so long...
			Nootka will tell you about the progress you've been making so far...
			
			Remained
        <translatorcomment>It may be better to say, &quot;Unanswered questions&quot;</translatorcomment>
        <translation>Remaining questions</translation>
        
			Given note show in the score
        <translation>Given note shown in the score</translation>
        
      color of pointed to note
      maybe: color (of) indicated note
        
			Which one is better:
					note in the score
					or
					note on the stave

- change background of some labels (strings freq) in audio in settings
- add example to 7th note widget
- under windows guitar head glyph doesn't appear in guitar settings.
- check is kind of instrument stored in exam file properly and appears in level preview
- there is some bug: QList claims... 
- level validation: when q: score & a: score or Q: name A: name and no different accidentals - switch solfege/letters
- consider to remove accidental symbol from NoteName question - pressed accid button should be sufficient.
- consider to have octave buttons in one row when there is enough space and in two rows when not only
- set better position of answer/repeat tip
- try to adjust navList widget width to the widest text in it
- make order with jack (thread-ise input, format convertion)
- add shadows under strings on pickup
- do not transform pickup image for lefthanded - just change its pos
- check intonation in exams
- There are similar position calculations in Tcanvas - make methods for them
- note name in HTML has two implementations - unify it
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- finish exam tip
- managing level and exam files and their paths
- check Russian Windows installer entries in *.nsi
- practicing MODE

- splash screen
- add sound at start

- add string numbers to pixmap


TGLOBALS & TTUNE
    - let setTune has reference Ttune& as parameter



SETTINGS DIALOG
	- avoid a size biger than screen resolution

      

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- check is possible to given exam file
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
