Plan for the Nootka One

urgent:
- Try to change parent of TclefMenu to accid button to make it disappear
- when audio output is disabled then selecting note/fret/name stops audio input - it waits infinity for the end of sound
- score with text toolbar it to narrow
- non classical guitars look, 0 fret, body
- question mark for less strings number is over the guitar widget
- decreasing strings number works only after resize guitar
- make order with jack
- images of NSIS installer
- table of level preview requires some margin/space after lines
- grand staff brace is still not adjusted
- frequency label has to show current strings number and tune
- next and repeat icons have different size (arrow) and look not nice

Add files to NSIS:
+ body-bass.png

- check intonation in exams
- There are similar position calculations in Tcanvas - make methods for them
- keep exam file in /tmp and restore it when crash or so
- splash screen
- add sound notifications
- finish exam tip
- crossfading of notes during palyback

- positions and look of frets numbers and key names in charts
- add string numbers to pixmap


TGLOBALS & TTUNE
    - let setTune has reference Ttune& as parameter



SETTINGS DIALOG
	- avoid a size biger than screen resolution

      

TSTARTEXAMDLG
  - TexamLevel has to be pointer or reference
  - also other instances of TexamLevel



TEXAMEXECUTOR
	- check is possible to given exam file
	- enable/disable sniffing durning exams (specially when no input is required)
  - think about hide octave in note name format when octaves are not required in answers. 
     Also for questions in "hint" - don't show octave when only name is required
