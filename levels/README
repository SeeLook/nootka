This directory contains Nootka exam levels distributed with the application.
They will be automatically loaded and visible inside Nootka on the level list.

Levels in this directory must have extra translatable tags:
<nameTR>Level name here</nameTR>
<descriptionTR>Level description here</descriptionTR>
and those are created by Nootka if name and description text starts with
tr(
but without closing ')' brace!

and to detect them correctly, lupdate has to find the texts first.
Since *.nel files are compressed they cannot be parsed by lupdate,
so they are placed in src/qml/level/Levels.qml file.

Than ordinary call:
lupdate -recursive ../src -ts some_file.ts
will update all texts from inside 'lang' directory

There are instrument specific levels inside subdirectories with name corresponding to instrument
