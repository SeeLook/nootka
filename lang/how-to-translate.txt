	HOW TO TRANSLATE NOOTKA
********************************************************************


Welcome !!!
Nice that You glanced here :-)

THANK YOU IN ADVANCE
For any question message me: seelook@gmail.com

=====================================================================
This process is very easy and doesn't require any programming skills,
 only some time and a bit of patience.
=====================================================================


I) Recommended method - translation with Qt Linguist
  1. Install Qt Linguist:
    - form http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ download QT online installer appropirate for Your system and run it
    - Go with creator and select 'custom' type of instalation when You want exacly only Qt Linguist
    - When You selected custom type of instalation deselect all components in next window
      and select only Qt Linguist (QtCreator has to be selected)
    - approve license and wait a while for instalation finish
  2. Download Nootka language file: http://code.google.com/p/nootka/source/browse/lang/nootka_xx.ts
      and change that xx in file name to Your language code to get file name like f.e.: nootka_en.ts
  3. Open this file by Qt Linguist
  4. In every moment You can generate a "lang package" form menu File->Release (file with *.qm extension)
      and put that file in Nootka instalation dir in lang directory 
      f.e.: path_to_nootka/lang/nootka_en.qm
      and run Nootka to see effects of the translation
  
  ************* A Few Hints *************************************
    * To approve transtaled entry You can use [CTRL+Enter] - it will be automatically merked as finished
    * Do note remove any special characters like \n %1 or HTML tags like <br> and <whatever>.
    * To copy oryginal entry use [CTRL+b] and then just translate.
      Obviously You can move this mischievous characters and tags
      to make proper whole transtaled sentence in Your language
    * PLEASE BE RESPONSIBLE !!! USE KIND WORDS AND OFFICIAL MUSICAL TERMS.
      DO NOT USE SOME SLANG WORDS EVEN MUSICAL. Nootka is used by children and pupils 

  =====================================================================
When translation will be ready or You give up :-( , send me what You have:
		seelook@gmail.com
      How to give some info about translator(You) You will find during translation
      Have good fun !!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
      
      
II) Alternate method - translate in text editor
    1. MS NotePad is good for nothing so first got some editor with syntax hightlight
       f.e.: Notepad++. Also there are online editors 
       (f.e.: create free acount on Cloud9 http://c9.io and upload the *.ts file there)
    2. Download Nootka language file: http://code.google.com/p/nootka/source/browse/lang/nootka_xx.ts
      and change that xx in file name to Your language code to get file name like f.e.: nootka_en.ts
    3. Open this file in Your editor
    4. Adjust entry
      <TS version="2.0" language="xx_XX">
      to Your language f.e.:
      <TS version="2.0" language="en_EN">
    5. Translate every message:
      <message>
	  <location filename="../src/charts/tnotepixmap.cpp" line="173"/>
	  <source>It was good!</source>
	  <translation type="unfinished"></translation>
      </message>
      to
      <message>
        <location filename="../src/charts/tnotepixmap.cpp" line="173"/>
        <source>It was good!</source>
        <translation> !!!!!!!!! HERE PUT A TRANSLATION !!!!!!!!!!!! </translation>
      </message>
      When finished - remove type="unfinished" from a tag.
    6. See hints above
