Welcome !!!

Nootka 0.7.0 beta1
This is beta version and can contain bugs or behave in unexpected way,
also it has unfinished features.
Inspite of that You are welcome to try.

To build Nootka from sources, see instructions inside source package.

NOTE!!!!
- Application creates *.nel and *.noo files (with levels and exam results)
    but it can't open it as launch parameter (nootka file.noo)
    - it is not implemented yet.
  Althought You can open it inside of application.
- Windows installer doesn't associate these extensions with icons.
